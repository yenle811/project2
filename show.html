              One day, "Me" - a highschooler - found a paperback in the
              hospital. The "Disease Coexistence Journal" was its title. It was
              a diary that "Me"'s classmate, Sakura Yamauchi, had written in
              secret. Inside, it was written that due to her pancreatic disease,
              her days were numbered. And thus, "Me" coincidentally went from
              Just-a-Classmate to a Secret-Knowing-Classmate. It was as if he
              were being drawn to her, who was his polar opposite. However, the
              world presented the girl that was already suffering from an
              illness with an equally cruel reality.
